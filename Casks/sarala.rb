  # Sarala's universal binary is ad-hoc signed (so it runs on Apple Silicon) but is
  # NOT Apple-notarized. Strip the quarantine attribute Homebrew sets so Gatekeeper
  # doesn't block the first launch — this is why plain `brew install --cask sarala`
  # works with no extra flags. (The official homebrew/cask repo forbids this, which
  # is fine: this cask is served from a self-hosted tap, not submitted there.)
